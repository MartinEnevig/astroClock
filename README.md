# astroClock

A project to use reinforcement learning to find optimal planet trajectories in a 2D model of the solar system

The usecase is an astronomical clock that is to show the location of the planets on any given day in 2D. The clock will have physical pieces representing the planets. When projecting the trajectories of the planets on to a two dimensional space, the planets will at time occupy the same spots. To avoid this the planet-pieces need to adjust their trajectories to avoid collision. The aim of this project is to use reinforcement learning to solve that problem.
